# Jack o'lantern generator

The goal: to be able to turn a photo into a low-quality jack o'lantern

Example:

![before](https://github.com/emmaremy/pumpkinator-boring/blob/master/cat.jpg =150x) ![after](https://github.com/emmaremy/pumpkinator-boring/blob/master/cat_pumpkin.png =150x)

To do:
* Fix noise reduction and smoothing
* Get the cutout on the pumpkin
* Make less awful
