# Jack o'lantern generator

The goal: to turn a photo into a low-quality jack o'lantern

### Example:

<img src="https://github.com/emmaremy/pumpkinator-boring/blob/master/cat.jpg" height="200"> 
<img src="https://github.com/emmaremy/pumpkinator-boring/blob/master/cat_pumpkin.gif" height="200">

### How to run

* Clone the repository
* Create a virtual environment, apparently in Python 2.7 (I really thought I'd done this in 3...)
* Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python pumpkin.py <image_path>`
* Creates two files: a static version and an animated version

### To do:
* Make less awful
